This program provides a linux equivalent of the Pharos Remote Printing Package available for Windows and Macintosh clients. This package will install a new CUPS backend that will allow printing to lpd queues on the pharos uniprint print server. Also it will install a new pharos popup server that will allow for users to input their ID's to be tied with the print jobs they send.

CUPS Backend
============
The cups backend is pharos. Since it uses lpd you need to change the group execution bits for lpd
Usage: 
cp pharos /usr/lib/cups/backend/
chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/backend/pharos
chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/backend/lpd
killall -HUP cupsd (or "/etc/init.d/cups restart" or "service cups restart")
lpadmin -p <queue name> -E -v pharos://<print server address>/<print queue>

Pharos Popup Server
===================
The pharos popup server must be running once a user logs into the desktop session. This popup server listens for incoming request from the cups backend. Once it receives a request it will popup a window asking for users ID. This ID is then returned to the cups system and tied to the print job as the $user.

Configuration
==============
The config file pharos.conf must be installed in /etc/

Logging
========
The cups backend ad the pharos popup server both have seperate logging. The level of logging can be controlled using the configuration file. The log files are written to the /var/logs/pharos directory. Make sure that it is world readable and writable.
