README
=====
This program provides a linux equivalent of the Pharos Remote Printing Package available for Windows and Macintosh clients. This package will install a new CUPS backend that will allow printing to lpd queues on the pharos uniprint print server. Also it will install a new pharos popup server that will allow for users to input their printing ID's to be tied with the print jobs they send. This will allow the users to use their printing ID's to release the print jobs at the pharos release stations.

2. wxPython library
	This python library is required to display popups used for printing to pharos printing queues.
	To verify if wxpython is installed
	a. Open terminal
