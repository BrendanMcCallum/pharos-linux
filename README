This program provides a linux equivalent of the Pharos Remote Printing Package available for Windows and Macintosh clients. This package will install a new CUPS backend that will allow printing to lpd queues on the pharos uniprint print server. Also it will install a new pharos popup server that will allow for users to input their ID's to be tied with the print jobs they send.
